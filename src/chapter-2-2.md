Before we can effectively solve problems, it is important to understand the different types of problems that we may encounter. In this chapter, we will explore some common types of problems and how they can be approached using problem-solving theory.

Well-Structured Problems
------------------------

Well-structured problems are those that have a clear desired outcome and a well-defined set of steps for achieving that outcome. These types of problems often have a clear solution that can be determined through analytical or logical thinking. Examples of well-structured problems include mathematical equations, programming tasks, and recipes.

Ill-Structured Problems
-----------------------

Ill-structured problems, on the other hand, are those that do not have a clear desired outcome or a well-defined set of steps for achieving that outcome. These types of problems often require creativity and innovation to identify potential solutions. Examples of ill-structured problems include interpersonal conflicts, environmental issues, and social justice problems.

Routine Problems
----------------

Routine problems are those that are encountered frequently and have a predictable set of steps for solving them. These types of problems can often be solved through established protocols or standard procedures. Examples of routine problems include technical issues with equipment, administrative tasks, and customer complaints.

Adaptive Problems
-----------------

Adaptive problems are those that require individuals to adapt their thinking or behavior in order to find a solution. These types of problems often involve complex or uncertain situations and may require a combination of analytical and creative thinking. Examples of adaptive problems include managing organizational change, navigating cultural differences, and addressing ethical dilemmas.

Conclusion
----------

Identifying the type of problem we are facing is an important step in effective problem-solving. By understanding the characteristics of different types of problems, we can apply the appropriate problem-solving strategies and techniques to achieve our desired outcomes.
